This document contains pathway analysis of air sparge samples collected from monitoring wells 1 to 8 (MW1-MW8). I used feature list generated and aligned by XCMS to identify KEGG IDs. Each detected feature was compared to KEGG database containing ~14,000 compounds. A compound within 10 ppm range of a KEGG compound is attributed with putative identification as the KEGG compound.

The abundance changes of each detected compound is presented with a colour code ranging between blue and yellow in each samples. Nodes of the pathways (i.e. circles representing compounds) has 8 divisions. Each division represents one sample and divisions are in order of MW1 to MW8.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
inputPanel(
        selectInput("name", label = "Choose a degradation pathway:",
            choices = c("xylene", "toluene", "naphtalene"), selected = "xylene"
        )
)

renderImage({
        filename <- normalizePath(file.path("./", paste(input$name, "_pathway", ".png", sep = "")))
        list(src = filename)
}, deleteFile = FALSE)
